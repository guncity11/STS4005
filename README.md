# STS4005 - Soft Skills Code Repository

A comprehensive collection of algorithmic solutions created specifically for the Soft Skills course at VIT-AP University. This repository is structured to provide clear and efficient implementations of various algorithmic problems categorized under Searching, Sorting, Recursion, and Backtracking. Each category is neatly organized into its own folder for ease of navigation and study.

## Categories & Problems

### Searching
- **Max Equilibrium Sum:** Find the maximum sum in an array where the sum of elements on the left equals the sum of elements on the right. Implemented using prefix and suffix sums.
- **Leaders in an Array:** Identify elements greater than all elements to their right. Solution involves scanning from right to left.
- **Majority Element:** Find the element that appears more than n/2 times in an array. Implemented using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.

### Sorting
- **Majority Element (Sorting Approach):** Sorting the array and identifying the middle element to find the majority element.
- **Natural Sort Order:** Sorting elements based on their natural human understanding, e.g., numerical value in strings.
- **Quick Sort and Selection Sort:** Implementations of classic sorting algorithms, quick sort using pivot partitioning, and selection sort by selecting the minimum element.

### Recursion
- **Sorted Unique Permutation:** Generate all unique permutations of a list in sorted order using recursion and backtracking.
- **Maneuvering:** Various recursive algorithms for navigating through data structures or solving problems.
- **Combination:** Generate all combinations of a given size from a set, a classic recursion problem.
- **Josephus Problem:** Solve the theoretical problem of selecting survivors in a circle using recursion.

### Backtracking
- **Maze Solving:** Finding a path through a maze from start to finish using backtracking.
- **N Queens:** Placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
- **Warnsdorffâ€™s Algorithm:** Heuristic method for solving the Knightâ€™s tour problem.
- **Hamiltonian Cycle:** Determining whether a Hamiltonian cycle exists in a graph.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders corresponding to each category of problems:

- `Searching/`
- `Sorting/`
- `Recursion/`
- `Backtracking/`

Each folder contains code files for the problems listed under its category. The code is written in a way that is meant to be educational and easy to understand, with comments explaining key parts of the algorithms.
